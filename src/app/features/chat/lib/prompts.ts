## Case Scenario Questions (Each scenario should be more than 6 lines):

Each scenario should:
- Present a **realistic, complex, nuance** legal or ethical dilemma.
- Include **multiple variables** (e.g., conflicting responsibilities, ethical considerations, client expectations).
- Require **critical thinking** and **strategic decision-making**.
- Be **specific and fact-driven**, avoiding clue overall that point to the correct answer.
- End with a clear **question** rather than suggesting a conclusion.

### Format:
1. **[Case Title]**  
   - **Scenario:** (A well-structured, thought-provoking situation.)  
   - **Options:**  
     - A) [A plausible but imperfect course of action]  
     - B) [A technically correct but ethically questionable choice]  
     - C) [A risky yet potentially justifiable alternative]  
     - D) [An incorrect or unethical approach]  

   **Answer:** Correct option (e.g., B)  
   *Explanation: A clear justification with legal principles, ethical considerations, and references.*  

(Continue this format for additional questions.)

## Example:
1. **Client Influence in Legal Strategy**  
   - **Scenario:** A lawyer representing a high-profile client in a civil case is pressured to file motions that have little legal merit but would delay proceedings in the client’s favor.  
     The lawyer knows that filing such motions could be seen as an abuse of the legal system, but refusing may strain the attorney-client relationship.  
     The client insists that this is standard practice and warns that they will seek another attorney if their demands aren’t met.  
     What is the best way for the lawyer to proceed?  

   - **Options:**  
     - A) Follow the client’s instructions, as their satisfaction is the priority.  
     - B) Refuse to file the motions and explain why, even if it risks losing the client.  
     - C) File the motions but take additional steps to ensure no ethical violations.  
     - D) Seek guidance from a senior colleague and comply only if the motions are technically valid.  

   **Answer:** B  
   *Explanation: While client interests matter, lawyers must uphold the integrity of the legal system. Filing frivolous motions (A, C) would be unethical, and D avoids taking responsibility. B is the best choice.*  

2. **Confidentiality vs. Corporate Interests**  
   - **Scenario:** A corporate lawyer learns that their client, a multinational firm, is about to finalize a contract with a supplier that has been secretly involved in illegal labor practices.  
     The lawyer’s firm also represents another client that could be harmed if this deal goes through.  
     Disclosing the information could protect the second client but might breach attorney-client privilege.  
     The lawyer is torn between their duty of confidentiality and the broader ethical implications of staying silent.  
     How should the lawyer handle this situation?  

   - **Options:**  
     - A) Disclose the information to the second client, prioritizing their well-being.  
     - B) Advise the corporate client on the risks but say nothing to the second client.  
     - C) Report the labor violations to authorities while maintaining client confidentiality.  
     - D) Withdraw from representing both clients to avoid conflict.  

   **Answer:** B  
   *Explanation: The lawyer cannot disclose confidential client information without consent (A). Reporting the violation (C) may still breach privilege. Resigning (D) avoids the issue but does not fulfill ethical duties. Option B balances legal obligations and professional ethics.*  

## References:
- It is ESSENTIAL to provide direct links to sources using the **file name** as the hyperlink label.  
- List them as bullet points under **References**.  
- Ensure all references cited in explanations are included.
